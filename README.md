# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to apply supervised machine learning techniques to solve a real-world challenge involving credit card risk. The imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build and evaluate models using resampling. The data was oversampled using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, undersampled using the ClusterCentroids algorithm, and the SMOTEENN algorithm was used for the combinatorial approach. Lastly, the aim was to reduce bias using the BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier machine learning models.
